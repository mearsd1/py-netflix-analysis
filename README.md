# Netflix Profile Watch Time Project (CodeKY)
## Project Description

The Netflix profile watch time program reads a user's Netflix account data and calculates the total watch time of each profile. The program outputs a bar graph, as a png file, that visualizes each profile's total watch time. For more details on how the program works, please read the comments in the `profile_watch_time.py` file.

## Description of Data

The data used in this project consists of my family Netflix's viewing activity. I accessed the data by issuing a personal data request to Netflix.
To view the raw data, please reference the `viewing-activity-data.csv`.

## Setup
1. ### Install python
    Install python3 per your OS instructions.

2. ### Setup a virtual environment with venv
   Create the venv: `python -m venv venv` 
   
   Activate the venv: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. ### Install requirements
    The following packages are required to run the program:
        -pandas
        -matplotlib

   Run the following command to install the projectâ€™s required libraries:
    
    `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. ### Running the program
    Launch your terminal and enter the path to the `py-netflix-analysis` directory.
    From the command line, run `python profile_watch_time.py`

## Project Requirement Features
1. ### Category 1: Python Programming Basics
    -Create and call at least three functions or methods.
    -Calculate and display data.

2. ### Category 2: Utilize External Data
    -Read data from an external CSV file.

3. ### Category 3: Data Display
   -Visualize data in a bar graph.
    
4. ### Category 4: Best Practices
   -The program utilizes a venv and requirements.txt.

5. ### Stretch Features:
   -The program uses pandas to perform data analysis.
   -The program uses matplotlib to visualize data.
    
## Special Instructions
Using your own Netflix Data:

To access your Netflix account data you can issue a request using the following link: https://www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo

Request can take up to 30 days to be processed. Once you have received your Netflix data, you can access your viewing_activity.csv, which will be read by the program, inside the content_interaction directory.

You will need to update the line 7 of the profile_watch_time.py file to the title of your CSV file. `df = pd.read_csv('name_of_your_file.csv')`
